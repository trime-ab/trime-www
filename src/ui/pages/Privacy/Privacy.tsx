          such information in their own right and Trime does not accept any responsibility for any Service Provider’s
          use of such information.
        </li>

    <h2>
      2. Information we collect about you
    </h2>
    <p>
      We collect information about you in a number of ways, in general when you use our Sites or Trime Services. Any
      information we collect will only be used in accordance with this Privacy and Cookies Policy.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2.1. Information you provide or make available to us
    </h3>
    <p>
      We collect personal information about you when you register for the App and use the App, including (as applicable)
      when you complete or update your profile on the App; communicate with us for any reason; make, accept or cancel
      Bookings; leave ratings, comments, feedback and/or scores for a Service Provider or User; and make Submissions.
      Such information may include your:
      <ul>
        <li>name</li>
        <li>gender</li>
        <li>
          contact details (including your address, email address and/or telephone number)
        </li>
        <li>
          Login (which may include the credentials you use for a third party service such as Facebook if you choose to
          register for the App using such credentials)
        </li>
        <li>
          any information which is publicly available as part of your Facebook profile, if you choose to register for
          the App using your Facebook credentials
        </li>
        <li>
          any information you include in your profile on the App and/or provide to us in connection with a Booking,
          including any sensitive personal data you choose to provide (for example, relevant information about your
          health and fitness) and any photograph you choose to upload from your mobile device or other device
          (“Device”).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>2.2. Information about you provided to us by other Users</h3>
    <p>Information about Users:</p>
    <p>
      We may ask each Service Provider to provide us with feedback and an overall score in relation to a User’s
      condition, strength, endurance and performance during the Booking. Such information may include sensitive personal
      data (for example, about health and fitness) about the User.
    </p>
    <p>Information about Service Providers:</p>
    <p>
      If you are a Service Provider, then following each Booking we ask the relevant User to provide a rating and
      comments about you and the Service Provider Services you provided.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3. Location Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect data about your location from your Device using GPS technology (“Location Data”). Location Data
      helps the App identify your location in order to help you make a Booking, or if you are a Service Provider to help
      us match you to Bookings based on your location. We will ask for your consent prior to collecting Location Data
      from you. You may withdraw such consent at any time by disabling the App’s access to your location using the
      settings within your Device or the App. If you do not give consent or withdraw it, you will still be able to use
      the App by manually identifying your location.
    </p>
    <h3>2.4. Payment Data</h3>
    <p>The App will ask you to input payment information (including credit card number, expiry date and CVC number) if
      you want to make a Booking. This information is collected directly by our third party payment processor, which
      uses such information to process payment from you. Trime itself does not have access to this information.
    </p>
    <p>Users: If you have already provided your payment details through the App and attempt to make another Booking, we
      ask our third party payment processor for details of the payment method(s) you provided previously so that you do
      not have to enter them again. These details are only partially made available to us (for example, we only see the
      last four digits of your payment card number), meaning that we never have access to your complete payment details.
      The App will then display such details to you so that you may use them to make another Booking.</p>
    <p>Service Providers: If you are a Service Provider, we will ask you for your bank account details so that we can
      make payments to you in respect of Bookings you have attended. We will treat your bank account details in
      accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
